If the bottom of our economic system doesn\'t have expendable income after all of the bills are paid, they can\'t recirculate it in the economy. Furthermore, if they\'re underpaid, they may have to make up the difference with government handouts, resulting in higher taxes. That also has an effect on the economy.

Tech IPOs are notorious for entering the market in the red (because no one is buying their shit). The investors buy the stock with the belief that the company will be more valuable when they sell it.\n\nThe stock market is only one of those indicators and is only a snapshot of how much publicly traded companies are worth. We can just as easily use median rent to income gap, which would be a snapshot of middle class to poverty economical health; or income disparity, which seems to correlate with the rise in popularity of socialism, which as I understand it, is bad for capitalism.

We don\'t expect a fix, we expect a humble empathetic heart.  And when you give us the same response our abusers gave us (essentially: get over it, here\'s why you should/can) there\'s no room for growth or safety, really.
